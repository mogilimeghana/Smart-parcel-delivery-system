#  Smart Parcel Delivery System

##  Overview
The **Smart Parcel Delivery System** is an intelligent, automated solution designed to streamline and secure the parcel delivery process.  
Using Python and Data Structures & Algorithms (DAA) concepts, this project simulates an efficient and reliable delivery mechanism — ensuring secure delivery authentication, reduced human error, and improved last-mile logistics.

This project was developed as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithm (DAA)** course to demonstrate the application of algorithmic problem-solving in real-world logistics.

##  Objectives
- Automate parcel delivery and pickup operations.  
- Implement algorithmic efficiency using data structures.  
- Ensure security and traceability of deliveries.  
- Provide visualization and analysis for delivery performance.

##  Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart-parcel-delivery-system.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash```
   cd smart-parcel-delivery-system
   
4. **Install required dependencies**
   
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib networkx

5. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   
   jupyter notebook "DAA_PROJECT(Smart Parcel Delivery System).ipynb"

## How It Works

1. The system accepts input data such as sender, receiver, and parcel     information.

2. It models the delivery network using graphs, where nodes represent delivery hubs and edges represent routes.

3. Shortest Path Algorithms (like Dijkstra’s) are used to determine the most efficient delivery route.

4. The system simulates parcel flow using queues to represent delivery order and scheduling.

5. The output visualizes routes, distances, and performance metrics using matplotlib graphs.
   
## Example Outputs

Visualization of the delivery network and optimized routes.

Efficiency comparison of different delivery algorithms.

Statistical summary of parcel delivery performance.

Graph-based visualization showing cost and time optimization.
